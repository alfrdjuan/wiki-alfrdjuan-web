# 1.4.1 Test Planning

> #### Definition by syllabus:
> Test Planning consists of defining the test objectives and then selecting an approach that best achieves the objectives within the constraints imposed by the overall context.

Test planning is the first step of test process. The test plan created by the test leader. 
But, if there is no test leader, the tester create the test plan. 
Test plan can be written or not, depending on the demand.

!!! Advice
Always have a written test plan! No matter if it's just one page or just testing date.
!!!

Even though test plan is the very first step, test planning does not only do happened once[^1].
In reality, we will change our plan. For example, when we want to test a project. 
While reading the project plan, we make a plan how to do the test. 
When on the implementation steps, turns out the test is harder than we thought because of misconfiguration or stuffs.
Thus, we will change the plan on how we do the test. 
In this scenario, we will do the test planning again.

There are no limit of you can do test planning [^need citations].


!!! Test plan != Project plan
Test plan only about testing. Project plan is all about the project, may include budget, requirements, etc.
