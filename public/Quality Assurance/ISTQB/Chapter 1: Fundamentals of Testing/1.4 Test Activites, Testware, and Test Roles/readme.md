## Test process
!!! Reminder
There is no one universal software test process.
!!!

There are 7 test process activities which will be discussed in this part
1. Test Planning
2. Test Monitoring & Control
3. Test Analysis
4. Test Design
5. Test Implementation
6. Test Execution
7. Test Completion

The process is **sequential** which means the next steps can't be done without previous process. 
But in reality the process is not sequential but overlapping and **some steps can be skipped**.
