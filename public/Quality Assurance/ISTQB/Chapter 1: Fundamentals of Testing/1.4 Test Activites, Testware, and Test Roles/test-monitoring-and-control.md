# 1.4.2 Test Monitoring and Control

> #### Definition by syllabus:
> Test monitoring involves the ongoing checking of all test activities and the comparison of actual progress against the plan. Test control involves taking the actions necessary to meet the objectives of testing.

**Test Monitoring** is on-going comparison of actual progress against the test plan using any test monitoring metrics.
**Test Control** is the actions needed to control the test process.
When doing test monitoring, we should have a **DoD (Definition of Done)** or exit criteria which defines how can a test be considered done.
For example, the exit criteria is number of test cases should achieve X, or the main Y features needed to have > 95 pass rate.

Test monitoring will be implemented into **test progress report**. Test progress report is a document of what have we done when doing testing. 
The documents content can be like the pass rate, the summary, analysis and such.

There are no universal template, so test progress report can be created based on what the stakeholders need to see.
