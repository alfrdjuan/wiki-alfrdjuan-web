> **There is no single universally applicable approach to testing.** Testing is done differently in different contexts (Kaner 2011)

testing is done differently in different contexts. Basically, dividing testing efforts between each projects based on scope, quality, risks, and budget. For example one projects need more time to tests and technique required, whereas the other project need less time to tests because we can ship an update.
