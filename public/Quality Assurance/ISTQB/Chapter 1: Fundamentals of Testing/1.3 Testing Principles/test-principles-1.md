# #1 Testing shows the presence, not the absence of defects

> #### Definition by syllabus:
> Testing can show that defects are present in the test object, but cannot prove that there are no defects (Buxton 1970). 
> Testing reduces the probability of defects remaining undiscovered in the test object, but even if no defects are found, testing cannot prove test object correctness.
