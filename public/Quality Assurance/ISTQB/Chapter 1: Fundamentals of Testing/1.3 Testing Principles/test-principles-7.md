# #7 Absence of Error is a fallacy

> #### Definition by syllabus:
> It is a fallacy (i.e., a misconception) to expect that software verification 
will ensure the success of a system. Thoroughly testing all the specified requirements and fixing all the
defects found could still produce a system that does not fulfill the users’ needs and expectations, that
does not help in achieving the customer’s business goals, and that is inferior compared to other
competing systems. In addition to verification, validation should also be carried out (Boehm 1981).

System that are perfectly tested and found no defects won't ensure the success of the system. 
For example the google plus. The developer has already delivered a great software, fixing every error and making sure the software is better than the competitor. 
But in reality, google plus is a big failure because they can't beat their competitor. Even though the software is in a best condition possible, it is not enough just to deliver perfectly working software.
